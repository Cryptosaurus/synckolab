<i>(2)</i> Choose a configuration display name. Make sure you do not use any special characters (including "-,.+# ) as name. If you entered a non-existant valid name, the next button will become clickable.<br/>
<img src="images/synckolab-wiz-2.png"/><br/>
<i>(3)</i> Select an imap account. If you do not see anything in the account box, you probably do not have an imap account. Ask your Internet Provider or System Administrator for an IMAP Account.<br/>
<img src="images/synckolab-wiz-3.png"/><br/>
Select which kind of data you want to sync. Calendar and Tasks will only be selectable if you installed the lightning extension.<br/>
<img src="images/synckolab-wiz-4.png"/><br/>
For each data-type (Contacts, Calendar, Tasks) you will see a similar wizardpage.<br/>
<i>(4)</i> select the adress book/calendar you want to use for syncing<br/>
<i>(5)</i> select if you want the (prefered) xml/kolab format or the vcard/ical format. It is recommended to use the xml format because the vcard/ical format is very outdated and not as clearly specified. <br/>
<i>(6)</i> select the folder that should be used for sync. Make sure you specify a different folder for calendar/adress book and tasks, otherwise the sync may fail<br/>
<i>(7)</i> The checkbox is only important for shared folders where you have read-only access. This makes sure synckolab does not try to write any data into the imap folder<br/>
Once you configured all of this the next Button will become clickable and take you to the next page. 

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<img src="images/synckolab-menu-options.png" alt="Option Menu under Tools"/><br/>
