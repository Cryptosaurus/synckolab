<h1>Sync Kolab</h1>
<p>
SyncKolab was written to add kolab functionality to thunderbird. It reads a selected Imap folder and synchronizes it with the local address book (and calendar in the future). It is currently under heavy development, so use with care!<br/>
It has been tested under Thunderbird 1 for Windows and Linux. Wheres under Linux it does not seem to work. I still working on that.
</p>
<h2>What is Kolab?</h2>
<p>
What it does is, that it loads all your contacts (from a selected address book), and synchronizes them with a selected imap folder. Where every contact is stored as an vcard. In the next version I also want to include calendar Entries (vCal)... For more information http://kolab.org/<br/>

The idea behind this is, that you can now have your contacts+calendar entries stored on the imap server. so you can actually have the same addresses on more than one computer. The kolab project has a  groupware server that uses imap to exchange calendar entries and vcards.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>synckolab 0.1.0 alpha</h3>
<p>
Step 1: <a href="synckolab-0.1.1.xpi">download it</a> (use "rightclick/save as" otherwise firefox will try to install) <br/>
Step 2: Open Thunderbird use Tools/Extensions then Install and install the xpi<br/>
Step 3: Restart Thunderbird<br/>
Step 4: Configure the server, address book and folder (see description)<br/>

Step 5: rightclick on the icon bar (next to Stop) go to customize and drag the "Sync Kolab" Icon to the 
bar<br/>
Step 6: click the icon and the sync will start<br/>
<b>MAKE SURE YOU READ THE RELEASE NOTES OF THE VERSION!!!</b>
</p>
<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<h3><a href="synckolab-0.1.1.xpi">synckolab 0.1.1</a></h3>
<p>
Fixed some nasty message bug. It should now download the online folders.
Still a bad bug on Linux which I cannot figure out (under linux it wont find my contact folder's messages???).
</p>
<h3><a href="synckolab-0.1.0.xpi">synckolab 0.1.0 alpha</a></h3>
<p>

This is a testing release. Do not use it in productive enviroments!!!<br/>
<b>This version might break your folder and your selected address book... use with care and BACKUP before use!!!</b>
After installing make sure to set the path and server right. Right now you also
have to make sure the imap folder you want to sync with is set for offline downloading and
downloaded (I added some code to download it, but it doesnt work yet... I guess). Just rightclick 
the folder you want, go to Offline, select "Select this folder for offline use" and press
"Download Now". After that it should sync just fine.

<h2>In the wild...</h2>
<p>I started a few threads around the globe on different sites during development. If you are interested in some insight you can check them out.

Antoher problem I ran into (which could have been avoided if the rewrite stuff had worked): <a href="http://xulplanet.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=282" target="_blank">Copying mail folder content from temp folder to imap</a>
I took some of the code from the TB Attachment Tools and TB Header tools for the writing of messages. You can get those pretty usefull extensions from <a href="http://www.supportware.net/mozilla/" target="_blank">Frank DiLecce (Ausdilecce)</a>.
