<h1>Sync Kolab</h1>
<p>
SyncKolab was written to add kolab functionality to thunderbird. It reads a selected Imap folder and synchronizes it with the local address book (and calendar in the future). It is currently under heavy development, so use with care!<br/>
It has been tested under Thunderbird 1 for Windows and Linux. Wheres under Linux it does not seem to work. I still working on that.
Since I do not always have cvs access, I may update this site less often then my regular homepage <a href="http://www.gargan.org">www.gargan.org</a>
</p>
<h2>What is Kolab?</h2>
<p>
What it does is, that it loads all your contacts (from a selected address book), and synchronizes them with a selected imap folder. Where every contact is stored as an vcard. In the next version I also want to include calendar Entries (vCal)... For more information http://kolab.org/<br/>

The idea behind this is, that you can now have your contacts+calendar entries stored on the imap server. so you can actually have the same addresses on more than one computer. The kolab project has a  groupware server that uses imap to exchange calendar entries and vcards.
</p>
<h2>In the wild...</h2>
<p>I started a few threads around the globe on different sites during development. If you are interested in some insight you can check them out.
</p>
<p>My homepage can be found in <a href="http://www.gargan.org">www.gargan.org</a> including a mirror of this + some other usefull things</p>
<p>This one is for those who have ideas on how I overcome some of my biggest problems: <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=223578" target="_blank">open a tb message in read/write mode</a><br/>
Antoher problem I ran into (which could have been avoided if the rewrite stuff had worked): <a href="http://xulplanet.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=282" target="_blank">Copying mail folder content from temp folder to imap</a>
I took some of the code from the TB Attachment Tools and TB Header tools for the writing of messages. You can get those pretty usefull extensions from <a href="http://www.supportware.net/mozilla/" target="_blank">Frank DiLecce (Ausdilecce)</a>.
