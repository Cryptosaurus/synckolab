<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<h1>Sync Kolab</h1>
<p>
SyncKolab was written to add kolab functionality to thunderbird. It reads a selected Imap folder and synchronizes it with the local address book (and calendar in the future). It is currently under heavy development, so use with care!<br/>
It has been tested under Thunderbird 1 for Windows and Linux. Wheres under Linux it does not seem to work. I still working on that.
Since I do not always have cvs access, I may update this site less often then my regular homepage <a href="http://www.gargan.org">www.gargan.org</a>
</p>
<h2>What is Kolab?</h2>
<p>
What it does is, that it loads all your contacts (from a selected address book), and synchronizes them with a selected imap folder. Where every contact is stored as an vcard. In the next version I also want to include calendar Entries (vCal)... For more information http://kolab.org/<br/>

The idea behind this is, that you can now have your contacts+calendar entries stored on the imap server. so you can actually have the same addresses on more than one computer. The kolab project has a  groupware server that uses imap to exchange calendar entries and vcards.
</p>

<h2>Want to help out?</h2>
<p>
Best thing you can do is get the most recent release, subscribe to the mailing list and ask what needs to be done (also take a look at the known bugs section). There is especially a lot of plain testing required. Since the extension is pretty new there are people needed who can test the extension on different Operating Systems, with some combinations of contacts (if all fields are transferred correctly) and so on...

</p>
<p>
You may aquire the current source code from the mozdev cvs, or get it directly from the xpi (simply unzip the latest xpi found on <a href="http://www.gargan.org">gargan.org</a> you will find all source files in there (js).
</p>
<h2>Known Bugs-missing Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>When selecting a new account in the option widow, the first time it will not display the folders correctly, it has to be done two times (any help?)</li>
</ul>
<h2>In the wild...</h2>
<p>I started a few threads around the globe on different sites during development. If you are interested in some insight you can check them out.
</p>
<p>My homepage can be found in <a href="http://www.gargan.org">www.gargan.org</a> including a mirror of this + some other usefull things</p>
<p>This one is for those who have ideas on how I overcome some of my biggest problems: <a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=223578" target="_blank">open a tb message in read/write mode</a><br/>
Antoher problem I ran into (which could have been avoided if the rewrite stuff had worked): <a href="http://xulplanet.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=282" target="_blank">Copying mail folder content from temp folder to imap</a>
I took some of the code from the TB Attachment Tools and TB Header tools for the writing of messages. You can get those pretty usefull extensions from <a href="http://www.supportware.net/mozilla/" target="_blank">Frank DiLecce (Ausdilecce)</a>.
