<h5 class="page-header">Release Notes</h5>
<h6>synckolab 0.2.1</h6>
<p>
Added a checkbox to sync without writing back to imap (helps speeding things up and pretty useful to make sure nothing is changed)<br/>
Some checks and exception catched so it wont break so easy. <br/>
When having a problem you can either subscribe to the mailing list (<a href="http://synckolab.mozdev.org/list.html">http://synckolab.mozdev.org/list.html</a>) or post in a forum where I check (xulplanet f.e.).
Make sure to post the exceptions/javascript messages so I can check where the problem is (also operating system/version of tbird and synckolab help).</p>

<h6>synckolab 0.2.0</h6>
<p>
This version works fine. I only tested it under windows with the contact folder selected for offline download and downloaded. It creates missing messages and cards. It should also correctly check all vcard fields.
</p>

<h6>synckolab 0.1.1</h6>
<p>
Fixed some nasty message bug. It should now download the online folders.
Still a bad bug on Linux which I cannot figure out (under linux it wont find my contact folder's messages???).
</p>
<h6>synckolab 0.1.0 alpha</a></h6>
<p>

This is a testing release. Do not use it in productive enviroments!!!<br/>
<b>This version might break your folder and your selected address book... use with care and BACKUP before use!!!</b>
After installing make sure to set the path and server right. Right now you also
have to make sure the imap folder you want to sync with is set for offline downloading and
downloaded (I added some code to download it, but it doesnt work yet... I guess). Just rightclick
the folder you want, go to Offline, select "Select this folder for offline use" and press
"Download Now". After that it should sync just fine.
