SynKolab 2.0.0
==============
    Major Clean Up:
     - change all functions into namespace functions
     - clean up so jslint doesn't complain

bugs fixed:
    Problematic variable assignment(mozdev issue)
    all jsLint issues resolved
    runs from the address window as well
    id column is now growing when changing the window
    mailing list support readded, fixed and tested
    rewrite of Event/Task integration
    #24845 correctly check if lightning is installed 
    #24850 calendar refresh
    #24848 caching messages locally
    #24202 conflict resolution without local sync db
    wrong folder was used in new layout (missed account name)
    cache was not deleted on config change 
    #24859 fix recurrence parsing (now even supports more than one day for weekly)
    #24904 fix problem with task field parsing and alarm sync
    #24905 fix problem with entries not writing back to imap 

new features:

    listener: synckolab binds itself to changed mail and address books. If enabled, 
    	you do not have to sync any more (except maybe on data corruption or at the
    	very start). Synckolab will be notified on any change in the address book or
    	on the imap server and update the data accordingly.
    better contact db storage: the contacts are now stored as json objects. This 
    	allows for a much quicker sync process.
    new configuration: you now have a more straight foreward configuration tree 
    	that allows the creation of multiple configs per account/sync type. This 
    	simplifies configuration.
    The internal structure has changed quite a bit allowing for much less code. 
    	this should also allow for more performance.
    The configuration changes are now recognized directly. You only need a restart
    	if you enable listener because the service binds itself only at the 
    	beginning (avoids double-binds).
